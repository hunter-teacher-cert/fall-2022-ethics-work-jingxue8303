Description of algorithm:
Certain seats should be reserved for special needs and they will not be included in the random selection. 
Ask a few questions: Are you in need of consective seats? How many? Why?
If not, then do the random selection
If yes, choose corresponding seats in the reserved sections.


Issues: 
The reserved seats might never get picked and airplane company loses money
People might not be truthful about the reasons why they need consective seats
The price for these pre-selected consective seats can be unfair to some groups
How to include all the legitment reasons? Who will define them?
